## Getting Tidy Data Project
###Description
This project read a dataset downloaded from [UCI HAR Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), making some transformations to tidy the dataset and write the result in a text file.

This project are compound by three files:
  * README.md, the file that you are reading now.
  * CodeBook.md, in this file explains how was the analysis applied to tidy the dataset.
  * run_analysis.R, this file is a R script to perform actions to tidy a specific dataset.

###Prerequisites
* Download [UCI HAR Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and extract its content to your working directory in "R"
* Install these R packages dplyr and tidyr

### Running the script
* Download run_analysis.R from this project to your working directory in "R"
* Start RStudio and execute this instruction: *source("run_analysis.R")*
